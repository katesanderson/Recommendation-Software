<h2 style="color:pink;">Description</h2> 
Users will be able to search for a type of food and my program will recommend local restaurants based on that food type.

<h2 style="color:pink;">Usage</h2>
This code would be helpful for travellers and tourists in a new city looking for recommended restaurants. The code could be further improved by adding extra functions such as asking the user if they want a specific star rating.
